# Movie Cast Finder
> A lightweight VanillaJS and Bootstrap movie cast search interface

This is a personal application intended mainly as a modern JS workout. No tutorials were used. ðŸ’¯ Trying to up my game at promises, async await, classes, ES6 Modules - import/export, Webpack, SASS etc.

## Usage example

This is a search interface for movie casts using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
You can search a movie by it's name and then choose from a list of movies which match with that name, after choosing one of the movies a list of cast members will be shown alongside their pictures, you're able to find out more information about specific cast members by clicking on an actor from the list.

<!-- !!!! Reminder to include their social medias on their info as well !!!! -->
<!-- !!!! Reminder on table hover to open the line up and render the actor's photo !!!!  -->

<!-- _For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Docs][docs]._ - soon -->
