## Usage example

The idea behind this app is basically a search engine for movie casts, done by inputting the movie name on the movie name input and being returned a list of movies which match with that name, upon choosing from one of the movies (displayed in a carousel) a list of cast members will be shown inside a table together with their pictures, you're able to find out more information about specific people from the cast by clicking on an actor from the list.
